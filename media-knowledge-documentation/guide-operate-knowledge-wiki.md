This guide covers day-2 operations for the `media-knowledge-documentation` deployment serving `https://documentation.pointsav.com`. For initial node provisioning, see `guide-provision-node.md`. For initial deployment bring-up (systemd unit installation, content-tree configuration, first service start), see `guide-deployment.md`.

The lessons in this guide derive from the v0.1.29 launch (2026-04-27) and reflect real surfaces touched during that pass.

## The surfaces you operate

The deployment runs on the workspace VM as a single binary (`/usr/local/bin/app-mediakit-knowledge`) under a dedicated `local-knowledge` system user. The runtime touches several surfaces:

| Surface | Path | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| systemd unit | `/etc/systemd/system/local-knowledge.service` | root, mode 0644 |
| systemd unit (IaC) | `~/Foundry/infrastructure/local-knowledge/local-knowledge.service` | version-controlled |
| Binary | `/usr/local/bin/app-mediakit-knowledge` | root, mode 0755 |
| Content tree | `<as configured by --content-dir>` | local-knowledge readable |
| State dir | `/var/lib/local-knowledge/state` | local-knowledge:local-knowledge |
| Citations registry | `/srv/foundry/citations.yaml` | local-knowledge readable |
| nginx vhost | `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/documentation.pointsav.com.conf` | root |
| TLS cert | `/etc/letsencrypt/live/documentation.pointsav.com/` | root |
| OS firewall | ufw (rules in `/etc/ufw/`) | root |
| GCP firewall | `allow-https-documentation` rule, `documentation-public` target tag | gcloud |
| DNS | DreamHost A record `documentation.pointsav.com` → VM public IP | external |

The unit, binary, citations registry, and IaC are version-controlled in `~/Foundry`. The content tree is version-controlled in `~/Foundry/clones/project-knowledge/content-wiki-documentation/` (or whichever subdirectory is named in `--content-dir`). State directory contents are non-canonical — the Tantivy search index rebuilds on startup from the content tree, so wiping state is non-destructive.

## Firewall — both layers must be open

The launch surfaced a class of bug worth memorising: the wiki serves on TCP/80 and TCP/443, and **both** the GCP firewall and the OS firewall (ufw) must permit those ports.

The v0.1.21 deployment had only the GCP firewall open on 80 and 443 (`allow-https-documentation` rule, `documentation-public` target tag). The OS firewall on the workspace VM ran ufw with `default deny incoming` and an `allow 22/tcp` rule for SSH only. The deployment had passed loopback smoke from inside the VM, but the public URL had never been reached from outside until certbot attempted the HTTP-01 challenge during the v0.1.29 launch. The challenge timed out; root cause was the OS firewall blocking 80 and 443 at the kernel level, behind the GCP firewall that was already open.

The fix landed in the workspace IaC at v0.1.29 in `infrastructure/configure/configure-ubuntu-foundry.sh`. New VM provisioning inherits the rules. A live VM provisioned before v0.1.29 needs the rules added once:

```
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw status numbered
```

To verify both layers from outside the VM:

```
# OS layer (any host with TCP connectivity to the VM IP):
nc -zv 34.53.65.203 80
nc -zv 34.53.65.203 443

# GCP layer (gcloud-authenticated host):
gcloud compute firewall-rules describe allow-https-documentation \
  --project <project-id>
```

If `nc` reports refused or timed out, the OS layer is the suspect even if the GCP rule is in place. The next vhost queued (`proofreader.woodfinegroup.com`) inherits both layers' fix automatically — no per-vhost firewall change is needed for a new vhost on the same VM serving the same ports.

## systemd unit and state directory

The unit is configured to run the binary as the unprivileged `local-knowledge` system user with hardening flags appropriate to a network-facing service that holds no secrets. Key sections:

```
[Service]
Type=exec
User=local-knowledge
Group=local-knowledge
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/app-mediakit-knowledge serve \
  --content-dir /srv/foundry/clones/project-knowledge/content-wiki-documentation/launch-placeholder \
  --citations-yaml /srv/foundry/citations.yaml \
  --state-dir /var/lib/local-knowledge/state \
  --bind 127.0.0.1:9090

Environment=WIKI_CONTENT_DIR=/srv/foundry/clones/project-knowledge/content-wiki-documentation/launch-placeholder
Environment=WIKI_CITATIONS_YAML=/srv/foundry/citations.yaml
Environment=WIKI_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/local-knowledge/state

NoNewPrivileges=true
ProtectSystem=strict
ProtectHome=true
PrivateTmp=true
ReadWritePaths=/var/lib/local-knowledge/state
```

To edit the unit, edit the IaC copy at `~/Foundry/infrastructure/local-knowledge/local-knowledge.service`, then propagate to `/etc/systemd/system/local-knowledge.service`, then reload and restart:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart local-knowledge.service
sudo systemctl status local-knowledge.service
```

The state directory at `/var/lib/local-knowledge/state` must exist, must be chowned to `local-knowledge:local-knowledge`, and must be named in the unit's `ReadWritePaths=` list. Initial creation:

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/local-knowledge/state
sudo chown -R local-knowledge:local-knowledge /var/lib/local-knowledge
```

The state directory holds the Tantivy search index (rebuilt on startup, incrementally updated on edit). Phase 4 will introduce redb databases for the wikilink graph, also in this directory. The directory is non-canonical state — wiping it loses no information, but causes a rebuild-from-content-tree on the next service start.

## Content directory and citations registry

Two paths configure what the wiki serves:

**`--content-dir` / `WIKI_CONTENT_DIR`** points at the Markdown tree the wiki renders. The current value (as of v0.1.29) is `/srv/foundry/clones/project-knowledge/content-wiki-documentation/launch-placeholder/`, the four-file placeholder subtree that enabled the public TLS launch without exposing the legacy corpus. To swap the served tree, edit the unit, daemon-reload, restart. The wiki has no in-flight requests to drain; restart is fast.

**`--citations-yaml` / `WIKI_CITATIONS_YAML`** points at the workspace citation registry at `/srv/foundry/citations.yaml`. The registry powers the editor's `[`-triggered citation autocomplete and the inline `[citation-id]` resolution at render time.

Editing either path follows the same pattern: edit the IaC, edit the live unit, daemon-reload, restart. There is no configuration-reload-without-restart path; the binary loads configuration once at startup.

## certbot lifecycle

The TLS certificate for `documentation.pointsav.com` is provisioned via certbot's nginx integration:

```
sudo certbot --nginx -d documentation.pointsav.com \
  --email open.source@pointsav.com \
  --agree-tos --no-eff-email
```

The HTTP-01 challenge requires TCP/80 reachable from the public internet (see §2 firewall). On the workspace VM, certbot's renewal runs via a systemd timer installed by the `python3-certbot` package; the timer fires twice daily and renews any cert with less than 30 days of validity remaining:

```
sudo systemctl list-timers | grep certbot
sudo certbot certificates
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

The current cert is valid through 2026-07-26. Renewal will fire automatically around 2026-06-26.

If renewal fails, the cert simply expires — nginx will continue serving the expired cert and browsers will warn. To detect failure, check the certbot timer's status weekly or wire a workspace-tier alert. Today neither is automated; workspace-tier monitoring is open work.

The HTTP→HTTPS 301 redirect on TCP/80 is installed by certbot's nginx integration. To verify after any nginx reconfiguration:

```
curl -I http://documentation.pointsav.com/
# expect: HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
# expect: Location: https://documentation.pointsav.com/
```

## ProtectHome trade-off

The systemd unit sets `ProtectHome=true`, which makes `/home`, `/root`, and `/run/user` inaccessible to the service. This is standard hardening for a network-facing service.

The trade-off: if the content tree lives under a user home directory (e.g., `/home/mathew/Foundry/clones/project-knowledge/...`), the service cannot read it, and the wiki returns 404 for every article on startup.

Two paths to avoid the trade-off:

1. **Keep the content tree out of `/home`.** The current production path `/srv/foundry/clones/project-knowledge/...` is already compliant; this is the recommended posture.
2. **Relax `ProtectHome` to `read-only`.** The unit can set `ProtectHome=read-only` instead of `true`; the service can read home-directory paths but cannot write. Adequate for a content tree managed via git on the operator's side. Less hardened than `true` but acceptable when path 1 is impractical.

Path 1 is preferred.

## Build coupling — libssl-dev and the workspace cargo

When rebuilding the binary from the cluster HEAD, running `cargo build --release` from the `pointsav-monorepo` root pulls in `service-content`'s `reqwest` dependency, which transitively requires `openssl-sys`, which requires `libssl-dev` at the system level. On a fresh VM without `libssl-dev`, the workspace-root build fails on that crate.

The operational build path for the wiki node until resolved:

```
cd /srv/foundry/clones/project-knowledge/pointsav-monorepo/app-mediakit-knowledge
cargo build --release
sudo install -m 755 target/release/app-mediakit-knowledge \
  /usr/local/bin/app-mediakit-knowledge
```

This keeps cargo's resolver scoped to the wiki crate's dependency graph (which uses only `rustls`, not `openssl-sys`). Three remediation paths are open: (a) install `libssl-dev` on the workspace VM; (b) switch `service-content`'s `reqwest` features from `native-tls` to `rustls`; or (c) tighten the parent workspace's `[members]` declaration. Both `apt install libssl-dev` and `apt install libgit2-dev` (needed for Phase 4's `git2` dependency) are queued for a Master-tier session on the workspace VM.

## Day-2 operations checklist

- **Check service health.** `sudo systemctl status local-knowledge.service`. Look for `active (running)`. Check journal for errors: `sudo journalctl -u local-knowledge -n 100 --no-pager`.
- **Smoke the public URL.** `curl -I https://documentation.pointsav.com/healthz` from any external host. Expect 200.
- **Smoke the route surface.** `/`, `/wiki/welcome`, `/feed.atom`, `/feed.json`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt`, `/llms.txt`, `/search?q=substrate`, `/git/welcome`. All should return 200.
- **Check the cert expiry.** `openssl s_client -connect documentation.pointsav.com:443 -servername documentation.pointsav.com 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates`. The `notAfter` should be more than 30 days in the future; renewal is automatic but worth checking monthly.
- **Check disk usage.** `du -sh /var/lib/local-knowledge/state`. The Tantivy index grows with content tree size; current placeholder content produces approximately 100 KB. A larger corpus will produce tens of MB per thousand articles.
- **Roll the content tree.** When swapping `--content-dir` (e.g., for a new content release), follow the §4 procedure: edit IaC, edit live unit, daemon-reload, restart, smoke. Restart is fast; no maintenance window required.
- **Rebuild and redeploy the binary.** When pulling Phase 4+ features into production, follow the §7 crate-scoped build pattern. After install, restart and smoke.

The wiki has no scheduled maintenance windows. Restarts are fast (under a second between `systemctl restart` and the next 200 response on `/healthz`). The Tantivy index rebuild on startup is non-blocking — the service answers requests during rebuild, returning empty search results during the rebuild window.
